    <h1>World's Simplest Budgeting Plan</h1>

            It's actually called <b>Conscious Spending Plan.</b><br>
            This is just my way of dealing with money after I read <b>I will teach you to be rich</b> by Ramit Sethi. 
            It is an amazing book that my friend recommended me 2 years ago which I ignored.

            There are four buckets that you will put your money into. The four buckets are:
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed Expenses</li>
            <li>Long-Term Investments</li>
            <li>Savings</li>
            <li>Guilt-free spending</li>
        </ul>
